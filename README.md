### EIT5_ESP_Cap_Switcher
This folder contains the code used on the ESP32 to control the switches.

### discussion_switching_topology
This folder contains the files used to calculate the TX-bandwidth optimisation as well as plot the figure seen in the discussion section.

### Effeciency_calculation
This folder contains the scripts and the data used to calculate the effeciency based on SG24 measurements.

### instrument_control
This folder contains the scripts to control the VNA via ethernet using the SCPI_visa protocol.

### optimsing_pi_match_components
This folder contains the scripts to find the optimal soltion for different scenarios as well as calculating the capacitor values for the switches. It also contains the S-parameters measured in the different scenarios.

### python_control
The code used to implement the control algorithm connecting the instrument_control and EIT5_ESP_Cap_Switcher
